# EDA-with-Python
This project involves exploring Best Movie sellers from 2009 to 2019 by Category. The major categories are genre:Fiction and Non-Fiction. I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate the relationship between the data variables and ensure that the data is right for subsquent analysis.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental data analysis and research stage. This method enables analysts to find patterns, trends, and relationships within a dataset, allowing them to gain insightful knowledge and guide further investigation. EDA offers a comprehensive knowledge of the data, highlighting its salient features and assisting in efficient decision-making.

After EDA the following  is a summary if insights gathered.
1. Fiction movies have higher reviews than Non-Fuction.

2. Non-Fiction Movies are more costly than Fiction Movies thus being the best sellers by categor.

3. Number of reviews and User ratind does not determine the pricing of a movie(minimal or Zero Correlation).
